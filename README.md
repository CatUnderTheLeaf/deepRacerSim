# deepRacerSim - Simulation for an AWS deepRacer car

## Installation

### With Docker

You might need to run ```xhost +local:root``` on the host machine to allow the Docker container to access the X11 server.

```
# change dir to this repository
cd deepRacerSim

# Build docker image with
docker build -f deepRacerSim.Dockerfile -t deep-simulator .
```

## Simulation

### Launch simulation
   ```
   cd /path/to/deepRacerSim/deep_ws

   # ---- if with Docker ----

   # launch a Docker container
   ./launch_docker.sh 

   # ---- else ----

   source devel/setup.bash

   # export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH and GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH from installation if they are not in ~/.bashrc

   # ---- endif ----

   # launch simulation
   # there will be 1-2 gazebo model errors - it is ok,
   # Gazebo just doesn't like .git files and stacked folders
   roslaunch simulation simulation.launch
   ```
### Control the car
   ```
   # in another terminal
   cd /path/to/deepRacerSim/deep_ws

   # ---- if with Docker ----

   # launch a Docker container
   ./launch_docker.sh 

   # ---- else ----

   source devel/setup.bash

   # ---- endif ----

   # launch keyboard teleoperation
   roslaunch teleop_ackermann key_teleop.launch

   # or launch joy teleoperation
   roslaunch teleop_ackermann joy_teleop.launch
   ```
